      <h1> About Me<br>
          <h4> My name is Herik Munoz. I am currently a freshman in college studying <a href="https://web.uri.edu/cs/academics/computer-science/"> computer science at the University of Rhode Island</a>.<br>
              I am currently trying to earn a <a href="https://web.uri.edu/cs/academics/computer-science/curriculum-bs/">BS in Computer Science.</a> My plan for the future is to do the <a href="https://web.uri.edu/cs/academics/accelerated-masters/">accelerated bachelor's to master's degree program.</a> This program will allow me to get my cyber security master's degree in only five years. <br>
              <br>
              I enjoy spending my days playing/watching sports or watching a streamer. My favorite sport to watch is basketball and my <br>
              favorite team is the Milwaukee Bucks. I love to watch anime and play videogames. My favorite anime of all time is Dragon Ball Z <br>
              because it the first anime that I have watched and it has a special place in my heart. I am a short, chubby, dominican man that grew <br>
              up in Cranston, Rhode Island.
