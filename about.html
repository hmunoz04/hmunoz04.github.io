              I enjoy spending my days playing/watching sports or watching a streamer. My favorite sport to watch is basketball and my favorite team is the Milwaukee Bucks. I love to watch anime and play videogames. My favorite anime of all time is Dragon Ball Z because it the first anime that I have watched and it has a special place in my heart. I am a short, chubby, dominican man that grew up in Cranston, Rhode Island.
